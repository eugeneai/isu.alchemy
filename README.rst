Alchemy storage for ISU Enterprise objects
==========================================

This package intended to be a way of object storage organization
by means of `SQLalchemy` engine.

The main idea is to analyze objects' Interface (schema) build of
`zope.schema.*` Field descriptions and construct a corresponding
ORM mapping.

I hope it could be done.
